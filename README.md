## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [next-boilerplate](https://github.com/lucacattide/next-boilerplate).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Using Docker

You may use Docker to run both the `development` environment than the `production` one too.

#### Development

Build the `development` image and run the container:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Production

Build the `production` image and run the container:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Remember to stop previous containers before switching from one to another, in order to avoid any issue:

```
docker-compose stop
```
