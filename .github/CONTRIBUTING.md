# Best Practices

## Styles & Coding

- HTML, CSS follow in general the [Google Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) conventions;
- JavaScript follows the [AirBnB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) conventions;
- Custom CSS follows the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) convention;

Please be sure to check and follow them before attempt any modification to the sources, in order to preserve the general integrity of the project patterns.
Third-party linter plugins like ESLint, Prettier, stylelint or any other similar resource are welcome (configuration files of the mentioned ones are already present).
